# `@workspace/api-keys`

This package provides utilities for managing API keys, enabling you to offer a public API with secure access. Please not this for a public API, not an internal API. For the internal API we use sessions.

## Features

- API Key Generation: Generates secure API keys for users or clients to access your API.
- API Key Validation: Validates incoming API keys to ensure authorized access.
